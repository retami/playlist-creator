# Playlist Creator

App to add recently broadcast songs from radio stations to YouTube playlists.

## Prerequisites

To set up the necessary credentials for using the *YouTube Data API v3*, follow these steps:
- Sign in to your Google account at google.com and navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials.

- Create a new YouTube API key with access to the *YouTube Data API v3*. Copy the API key to the `bin/api-key` file.

- Create a new OAuth 2.0 client ID and client secret. Copy the client ID and client secret to the `bin/client-secret.json` file.

In case the default system CA bundle is not found, when running the app, you need to set the `curl.cainfo` option in your php.ini:
- Download the CA bundle from https://curl.se/ca/cacert.pem.
- Set `curl.cainfo` to the bundle's location in your php.ini: `curl.cainfo = '<your_path>\cacert.pem'`
